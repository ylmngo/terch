The Open function of the os package opens the text file, and the Close function closes the file with a defer statement. The Create function creates a gzipped file, and the NewWriter function of the gzip package writes the content of the text file to the gzip file using the Copy function of the io package.
The Flush method of the gzipWriter instance flushes the gzip writer once all the data is available on the zipped file.
You can retrieve the original file from a gzipped file through a decompression process. The process of decompressing a file is similar; you’ll open the file and create a gzip file reader, then create a new file to hold the uncompressed data before copying the contents to the new file.
Zlib is a library for data compression and decompression; the library also uses the LZ77 algorithm. Zlib is written in C and is widely used as the basis for other compression libraries and software. Unlike gzip, zlib is a library, and zlib does not include a file format. However, it is often used to compress data stored in container formats, such as PNG or HTTP.
The process of compressing with zlib is the same as for gzip. You’ll create a zlib file, configure a writer, open the original file, and copy the contents to the compressed file
